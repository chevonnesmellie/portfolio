          <h1>About Chevonne Smellie</h1>
          <h2>Front-end developer based in Mississauga, ON</h2>
          <p>
            After I earned by Bachelor of Science in Biology & Health Studies at
            the University of Toronto, I enrolled in a year-long course in
            Bioinformatics at Seneca College. This is where I was first
            introduced to the capabilities of coding and computer science. I
            found coding facinating and very enjoyable, however upon graduation,
            my career took me in a direction away from my new found hobby. In
            2021, when I was feeling stuck at my job and actively searching for
            new challenges and opportunities, I decided to take another course,
            this time in coding. I'm happy to find that I still enjoy coding
            just as much as I did in 2012, and I love that there will always be
            more to learn, more to challenge myself with, and always room to
            grow.
